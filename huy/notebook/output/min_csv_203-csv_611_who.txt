assistant: The question about the "500 club" refers to a group of Major League Baseball players who have hit 500 or more home runs over the course of their careers. The table provided only shows one player, Barry Bonds, with 762 home runs, which is the most home runs hit by any MLB player. However, without additional information about other players in the 500 club, it is impossible to determine who has the least amount of home runs within that group.

To answer the question accurately, a complete list of players in the 500 club and their respective home run totals would be required. Since the table provided does not include this information, I cannot provide the name of the player with the least amount of home runs in the 500 club.
