assistant: The provided table only contains information about one player, Barry Bonds, with 762 home runs (HR). The "500 club" refers to players who have hit 500 or more home runs in their careers. Since the table does not provide information about other players in the 500 club, it is impossible to determine from the given data which player has the least amount of home runs within that group.

To answer the question, additional data on other players who are members of the 500 club and their respective home run totals would be required. Without that information, the question cannot be answered.
